## üé® Design Philosophy & Color Choices

### Primary Color Palette

| Color | Hex Code | Usage | Psychology |
|-------|----------|-------|------------|
| ![#ffc107](https://via.placeholder.com/20/ffc107/000000?text=+) *Warm Yellow* | ‚Å†‚ÄØ#ffc107‚ÄØ‚Å† | Primary actions, highlights | Optimism, energy, productivity |
| ![#333333](https://via.placeholder.com/20/333333/000000?text=+) *Charcoal* | ‚Å†‚ÄØ#333333‚ÄØ‚Å† | Text, headers | Professionalism, readability |

### Why These Colors?

*üü° Warm Yellow (#ffc107)* - The cornerstone of our design

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Accessibility*: High contrast against dark text, ensuring readability
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Brand Differentiation*: Stands out from typical blue/green productivity apps

*‚ö´ Charcoal (#333333)* - Professional and readable
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Readability*: Softer than pure black, reducing eye strain
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Professional Appeal*: Conveys seriousness and reliability
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Modern Aesthetic*: Contemporary alternative to harsh black text

The color combination creates a *warm yet professional* atmosphere that encourages productivity while maintaining visual comfort during extended use.
